# 04-Coding-Quiz

## Description

This project is designed to test the user's knowledge in coding. While working on this project, I was also able to practice and develop my JavaScript skills. 
One of the main problems I encountered while working on this coding quiz was understanding how functions work, specifically how scope affects a function. I was able to learn and troubleshoot my issues with scope as I worked through this project.
